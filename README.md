# Maze-Program
This program inputs a rectangular maze along with its size and the starting position of where the player will start at. The maze is marked with the character '*' around the edges. There are also other obstacles such as lava, represented as 'L', and water, represented as 'W'. The object of the game is to get to the end of the maze, represented by the character 'E', finding the shortest possible path. The character '-' marks where the player stepped as well as the character '+'. However the plus character represents when the player stepped in water. It is marked differently because when the player walks in water, it is counted as two steps, rather than just one.
